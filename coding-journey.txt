Here's my journey to learn code from zero experience
- watch and learn coding tutorial from any platform like Youtube,Instagram,anywhere
- practice and try to code everything at least one line command everyday
- focus at least to one programming language and be a master.until this,i'm started to learn PHP and still enjoying this.my dream in future is to be software engineering.cheers
